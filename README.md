# Personal Website / Portfolio

Website name: AFKurtz.github.io

This repository contains the source for my GitHub Pages website.
The goal of this site is twofold:
1. **Professional Overview**
- Provide hiring managers and collaborators with a clear snapshot of who I am
- Highlight my skills, interests, and technical focus areas
- Showcase completed and ongoing work in an accessible format

2. **Project Development Hub**
- Maintain Detailed Records of project concepts and experiments
- Track progress through timelines, milestones, and iteration notes
- Demonstrate problem-solving process

Rather than acting as a static résumé, this website is interded to evolve alongside my work

## What You'll Find Here

- Personal background and goals
- Portfolio highlights
- Active project logs and roadmaps
- Archived experiments and ideas
- Updates as projects progress

## Why This Exists

I believe the process behind building something is just as valuable as the result. By documenting development openly, I aim to:

- Show transparency in how I approach challenges
- Practice structured planning and reflection
- Create a centralized place for professional visibility

## How it's made

The majority of the code was generated using Mobirise 6.1.12 using free templates. The software makes it easy to build the website visually. Once the website looked good, the code was exported to Visual Studios Code to add additional functionality. Updates to project lists will be made in Visual Studios Code.

This repository powers the site itself. Content and structure will continue to evolve as new projects begin and existing ones mature.
