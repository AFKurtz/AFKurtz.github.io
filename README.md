# Personal Website / Portfolio

Website name: AFKurtz.github.io

This repository contains the source for my GitHub Pages website.
The goal of this site is twofold:
1. **Professional Overview**
- Provide hiring managers and collaborators with a clear snapshot of who I am
- Highlight my skills, interests, and technical focus areas
- Showcase completed and ongoing work inan accessible format

2. **Project Development Hub**
- Maintain Detailed Records of project concepts and experiments
- Track progress through timelines, milestones, and iteration notes
- Demonstrate problem-solving process

Rather than acting as a static résumé, this website is interded to evolve alongside my work

## What You'll Find Here

- Personal background and goals
- Portfolio highlights
- Active project logs and roadmaps
- Archived experiments and ideas
- Updates as projects progress

## Why This Exists

I believe the process behind building something is just as valuable as the result. By documenting development openly, I aim to:

- Show transparency in how I approach challenges
- Practive structured planning and reflection
- Create a centralized place for professional visibility

This repository powers the site itself. Content and structure will continue to evolve as new projects begin and existing ones mature.
